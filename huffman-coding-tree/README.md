This program demonstrates the Huffman Coding Tree technique
by encoding and decoding the Pride and Prejudice text file.

# encode-text.cpp #
Encodes the Pride-and-Prejudice.txt file, outputs encoded text into a file "pride.huff", and generates a huffman coding scheme for decoding "huff.sch"

# decode-text.cpp #
Decodes the encoded pride.huff file using the scheme file "huff.sch" and outputs result into "pride_decoded.txt"
